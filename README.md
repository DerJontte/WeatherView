# WeatherView
Personal project: a simple Android app with accompanying widget for viewing the current outdoor temperature. Currently hardcoded to only fetch data from the weather station closest to where I live.

02.04.2019: The app crashed every time it has tried to update the temperature since last weekend. I have to look into it and see if the problem is with the app or the server as soon as I have some time to spare.
